# The Ikea Effect: Why We Fall in Love with Our Own Work

You spend hours assembling an Ikea bookshelf, wrestling with confusing instructions. When finished, that wobbly piece of furniture suddenly looks perfect. You love it more than any store-bought alternative. This is the Ikea effect – and it's affecting your work decisions.

## What Is the Ikea Effect?

Behavioral economists Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely discovered that people value things they create 63% higher than identical items made by others. We become irrationally attached to our own work, regardless of its objective quality.

## How It Shows Up at Work

- **Your code**: That function you debugged for hours? Obviously the most elegant solution possible.
- **Your strategy**: The plan you crafted over weeks feels brilliant and comprehensive.
- **Your process**: The workflow you designed must be perfect – if others find it confusing, they need training.

## Why This Is Dangerous

The Ikea effect prevents objective evaluation. We become defensive about feedback, dismiss better alternatives, and continue investing in failing projects because we can't abandon our "baby."

## Recognizing the Warning Signs

- Feeling defensive when someone suggests changes
- Explaining why your approach is better instead of listening
- Reluctance to scrap work you've invested time in
- Taking criticism of ideas as personal attacks

## How to Combat It

**Seek early feedback**: Involve others in creation from the start. When multiple people contribute, you feel less sole ownership.

**Build in cooling-off periods**: Step away after completing work. Mental distance helps objective evaluation.

**Practice devil's advocate**: Actively look for flaws in your own work.

**Set clear success metrics**: Define objective criteria before starting, not subjective feelings.

The Ikea effect isn't entirely bad – it increases motivation and quality. But awareness helps balance healthy pride with openness to improvement. Next time you defend your solution, ask: "Is this truly best, or just mine?"
